        <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway? </h2>
        <p>
          I want to have freedom, but also purpose, my previous career felt like i had neither of these, had the 7-5 slog and had transitioned in to turning up to work and 
          repeat the same thing day in day out.  Thats why i have made the jump to web development, firstly purpose be in working in a group to create a product that has 
          provided challenges along the way, also hopefully after gaining the skills of working in a team environment have the option of working remotely, giving me the 
          ability to not miss out on the important things in life, I feel like at times work should be molded around life. 
        </p>
        <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
        <p>
          Strengths of mine related to learning are my persistence to work on a task until understood, my logical way to try break any larger amount learning topic down 
          to more understandable pieces. Also once i truly understand something i seem to have a great recall for that bit of information. 
        </p>
        <p>I feel like i have a poor ability for remembering information after reading or watching something, like above i fell like i have to keep learning until i get to the point of understanding. But for some reason things such as learning coding skills seems to get “implanted” in my memory far better than someones name. 
        </p>
        <h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
        <p>Would like to develop more leadership skills in larger groups, knowing when to take a break when something inst working, and gain more control of getting my self in the “zone”.
        </p>
        <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h2>
        <h2>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
        </h2>
        <p>Get to know all team members or home group at least of some basic level, everyone has different ideas as what is right. Hopefully once this done everyone including myself would feel more comfortable speaking up to resolve an issue.
        </p>
        <h2>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you 
        </h2>
        <p>Speak to a Facilitator at the earliest possible time, explain what is causing the issue and how you think it can be resolved.  Also sometimes speaking to close family or friends who are not part of the dev academy could give me a fresh take on the issue.   
        </p>
        <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h2>
        <p>Using the toggl app and see i have went well over the timebox suggestions i will seek assistance from a facilitator, possibly firstly in the tech questions.
          Have a look over a complete task and set some “flags”” at certain days what part i should be up to, if i look to be falling behind seek help.
        </p>
        <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
        </h2>
        <p>Be supportive if i come for help firstly possibly not providing the answer but a direction, as some time that is all that is needed.  Honest with my work and provide constructive criticism when it is required 
        </p>
        <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
        </h2>
        <p>I have a pretty flexible days with no commitments such as children, still i believe I need to set blocks during the day when i should be studying.
