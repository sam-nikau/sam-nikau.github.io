          <h2>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h2>
          <h3>
              To try make these easier to understand, lets think of them combined as a city.  HTML provides the structure, the 
              divisions, the parks and where they are, is the park inside a city block of houses or is the park completely surrounding the Libiary.
              Next is CSS, think of this as the style, back to our city, this could change how big the park is, is it all green grass or massive trees 
              with golden leaves, even how big those skyscrapers are.
              Finally JavaScript, this is used to create interactive functionality. This could give the city its life, the park could now have those 
              icecream trucks depending on the weather and that skyscraper now has a viewing platform that charges $10 a session.

          <h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.</h2>
          <h3>
            Computers are complex machines but follow a very simple process when reading code. Starting from the top, and will not 
            progress down until it has completed the previous, this is control flow, 
            Loops in a programing language almost trap the control flow in a cycle allowing the same thing to happen with minor changes until a 
            total is reached. However if this is setup in correctly this endless loop can be enough to crash the application.

            Lets use the method of baking a cake.
            <li>
              
            </li>
