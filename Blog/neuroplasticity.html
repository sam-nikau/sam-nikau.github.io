                <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
                <p>
                    Though-out most of history, it was thought that everyone was born with varying degrees of 
                    intelligence and this was fixed for the life of that person, however recently it has been 
                    proven how “plastic” the brain is, it is not a fixed organ but something that can grow and change depending on the environment that it is in.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just the understanding of this allows people to perform significantly better than a group that
                     are unaware of this.  Possibly due to the fact that once we understood this we are more motivated to study or put more effort in.
                </p>
                <h3>Ways to benefit from Neuroplasticity</h3>
                <p>
                    Repeating an activity even if I think I already know the information, just the quick process of going over it 
                    again will have the ability to recall it far better in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Putting information in context, or relating it to something that you enjoy, can greatly help recall that information, 
                    this works by creating new pathways that are tapped in to existing pathways.
                </p>
                <h3>Increasing Neuroplasticity</h3>
                <p>
                    Sleep,
                    possibly the most important assists with neuroplasticity,by taking the information we have gathered during the day is processed and stored in a more long term area,
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aerobic exercise, this isn’t directly related to an increase in neuroplasticly by itself, however it does increase blood flow in the brain which in turn has
                     in some studies been shown to increase the size of the hippocampus which is the “hub” for long term memory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mindfulness or Meditation, which reduces the body’s stress has massive amounts of positive effects, in todays world, we have constant stressors which cause 
                    our sympathetic system to remain engaged.Reducing these stressors has in turn has been shown to increase grey matter in parts of the brain and especially the hippocampus.

                <h2>Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset</h2>
                <p>
                    A fixed mindset means that you believe  intelligence is fixed,  so if your not good at something, you would believe that you’ll never be good at that.  
                    This type of person would usually give up easily and sees temporary setbacks as permanent failures, this can lead to them avoiding challenges and thus the option to learn something new.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However a growth mindset is basically is the understanding that we can all get smarter,  once we understand this it allows us to put in extra time and effort to a task, and in turn leads to high achievements.  
                     They look forward to challenges as opportunities to master a new skill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had begun to understand the concept of this a couple of years ago, through various podcast and books.  At a younger age if I did something I wasn’t good at 
                    I would try avoiding that task, firstly because I didn’t like not been good at it and also thinking that no matter how much time I spent on I would never be
                     good.    I have since changed that mindset, and now believe through constant practice with time and effort almost any thing can be achieved, and not letting a small failure turn in to a permanent failure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Further understanding of both neuroplasticly and a growth will allow me to think of all challenges as a stepping stone to getting closer to mastering a skill,  that learning a new skill we must do things we won’t
                     be good at and there will be time we will fail, and to think of these also only temporary set backs.
