            <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
            <p>Emotional intelligence is our ability to understand, control and use our emotions in positive ways,  such as control stress, communicate well with others and overcome challenges.     
              Someone with a higher EQ is able to “feel” their and others emotions, use this information to help try improve the situation before it potentially leads to negative results.
            </p>
            <p>There are five categories</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Self-awareness,  Are we able to understand our brain, can feel our own emotions, everyone has up and downs, and been self aware gives them the ability see these changes in emotions.
              </li>
              <li>Self-regulations.  You cant control something if you don't realise your doing it, so after the self-awareness, you are now able to control your undesired emotions
              </li>
              <li>Social skills.  Gives you the ability to communicate effectively,  saying what you want and need.
              </li>
              <li>Motivation. We will always make mistakes, be given criticism, it is all the part of learning.  And depending on how well we continue and not give up, is a great factor in how well and quickly we improve.
              </li>
              <li>Empathy. Possibly the most important for career success.  Allows people to be great leaders, by understanding what their team members are feeling and provide what they need to for them to be their best.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
            <p>EQ becomes far more important in the upper management positions.  Someone with a higher EQ is able control conflicts, they have a greater ability to identify, access and control the emotions of themselves and others.
              While IQ, is the ability to learn and understand, can be very logical, they can be very good at solving the problem at hand.
              </p>
              <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
              <p>In leadership positions it is important as it can help build relationships, reduce stress in the work place, solve conflict and overall help improve job satisfaction.  It can help massively produce a more productive work place, by sensing where there are issues, bring these forward and provide a positive outcome.  
                It can give us control over our emotions and let use make  more informed decisions, rather than let our emotions run wild and makes decisions that otherwise would not have been made.
