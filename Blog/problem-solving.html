				<h2>Being blocked on a simple problem:</h2>
				<p>
					While doing the Built-in Methods creating a function to capitalize every word in a
					given sentence, I started off by checking what the test sentences
					were, all strings so would require first been converted to an array.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once all the words were in an array I used the map method to “map” over
					each array of strings and proceed to capitalize each word, searching on google
					how to do this. Feeling confident I put a lot of code in one line. See
					below
				</p>
				<p>
					I was getting an error that it wasn't correct, because I wasn't
					experienced with most of the methods such as such as .map, .charAt and
					.slice I was certain it was one of these that was incorrect, I had
					just done the join method so was sure this was correct.
				</p>
                <img src="/Pictures/capitalize-function-incorrect.png" alt="">
				<p>
					So rushing in to change what I thought was wrong, it completely made it worse and confusing the error and myself even more. After searching google I changed the code, tried many more ways still
					not working. Because the final return was on one line I didn't / couldn't
					console.log it, splitting the result to a variable before returning
					allowed me to see my simple mistake.
				</p>
				<p>
					During this process I starting to lose confidence to even follow code
					on google. This simple
					problem I learnt the power of console log, if having issues do it on
					every step and also not to assume some parts of my code was correct.
					If i had been struggling for a while go over the whole lot.  Also taking a break while been blocked, coming back to it and reviewing the whole code again, explaining to the rubber duck every step, during this "chat" the duck solved the problem just like that.

				<h2>That time I elegantly solved a problem.</h2>
				<p>
					Both of the fuzzbuzz problems I seemed to solve quickly, because the
					logic of it was simple and the steps were easy to follow, I was able to do the Pseudocode in my head and
					work through the list i had created.
				</p>
                <img src="/Pictures/fizz-buzz-solution.png" alt="">
				<p>
					As above the main problem solving was the Pseudocode, its something I
					still am terrible at writing down when doing more complex problems, possibly
					because I feel it is taking up time when I could have begun to type
					code to start to solve it.

				<h2>
					Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
					techniques/processes:
				</h2>
				<p>
					Pseudocode - Im terrible at this, possibly part of the issue was I
					thought I could look at the tests and work out the steps to take from
					that.  Plus i seem to think this takes to much time. Something I will need to change.
				</p>
				<p>
					Trying something - Possibly one of my strongest techniques, try
					something consolelog to check the result and make changes, during this
					process I usually get a better understanding of the methods used ect,
					can be far to easy to “copy” code which works and have no idea why.
				</p>
				<p>
					Rubber ducky method - Cant say I do this very often, but just taking a
					break, forgetting and not thinking about the problems, then coming
					back to it, making me start fresh has definitely helped me.
				</p>
				<p>
					Reading error messages - Follow these a lot, I common mistake can be
					trying to using a variable that hasn't created yet.
				</p>
				<p>
					Console.logging - I use a lot when im unsure if im doing the method ect
					correctly, also when trying to work out what information ia getting
					passed in to my function ie an array, string or other.
				</p>
				<p>
					Googling - Do this a lot, it almost seems like some one out there has
					had the same issue and asked it online.  W3schools if a feel like i need the basics then mdn to further understand it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Asking your peers for help - Usually I find someone else else that has
					had the same issue, I try to avoid asking to early as solving it
					myself is a far greater learning curve than been given the answer, or
					a hint that is to “good”.
