				<h2>Being blocked on a simple problem:</h2>
				<p>
					While doing the Built-in Methods creating a function to capitalize a
					given sentence, i started off by checking what the test sentences
					were, all strings so would require first been converted to an array.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once all words were in an array i used the map method to “map”over
					each string and procede to capitalize each word, searching on google
					how to do this. Feeling confident i put alot of code in one line. See
					below
				</p>
				<p>
					I was geting an error that it wasnt correct, because I wasnt
					experienced with most of the methods such as such as .map, .charAt and
					.slice i was certain it was one of these that was incorrect, I had
					just done the join so sure this was corect. See below.
				</p>
				<p>
					After searching google alot i changed the code, tried of ways still
					not working. Because the final return was on one line I didnt/ couldnt
					console.log it, splitting the result to a variable before returning
					abled me to see my simple mistake.
				</p>
				<p>
					During this process i starting to lose confidence to even follow code
					on google i believe i was doing it correctly. During this simple
					problem I learnt the power of console log, if having issues do it on
					every step and also not to assume some parts of my code was correct.
					If i had been struggling for a while go over the whole lot.

				<h2>That time I elegantly solved a problem.</h2>
				<p>
					Both of the fuzzbuzz problems I seemed to solve quickly, because the
					logic of it was simple, I was able to do the Pseudocode in my head and
					work through the list i had created.
				</p>
				<p>
					As above the main problem solving was the Pseudocode, its something I
					still am terrible at when doing on mores complex problems, possibly
					because i feel it is taking up time when I could have begun to type
					code to start to solve it.

				<h2>
					Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
					techniques/processes:
				</h2>
				<p>
					Pseudocode - Im terrible at this, possibly part of the issue was i
					thought i could look at the tests and work out the steps to take from
					that.
				</p>
				<p>
					Trying something - Possibly one of my strongest techniques, try
					something consolelog to check the result and make changes, during this
					process i usually get a better understanding of the methods used ect,
					can be far to easy to “copy” code which works and have no idea why.
				</p>
				<p>
					Rubber ducky method - Cant say i do this very offen, but just taking a
					break, forgetting and not thinking about the problems, then coming
					back to it, making me start fresh has deflintely helped me.
				</p>
				<p>
					Reading error messages - Follow these alot, i common mistake can be
					trying to using a variable that hasnt created yet.
				</p>
				<p>
					Console.logging - I use alot when im unsure if im doing the method ect
					correctly, also when trying to work out what information ia getting
					passed in to my function ie an array, string or other.
				</p>
				<p>
					Googling - Do this alot, it almost seems like some one out there has
					had the same issue and asked it online.
				</p>
				<p>
					Asking your peers for help - Usually i find someone else else that has
					had the same issue, I try to avoid asking to early as solving it
					myself is a far greater learning curve than been given the answer, or
					a hint that is to “good”.
